This is a short guide for how to use the template project for Nano Studio 2. Nano Studio 2 is available for iOS, iPadOS and macOS and is free to download through the App Store.

The template pre-configures an instrument per MIDI channel such that you can use the channel (CH) functionality on your MONKEY and take full advantage of the looper. Thats it.

To start using the template we will:
- download the template file
- move it to the Nano Studio 2 template directory
- create a new project using the template

## Download and Open Files

Start by downloading the template from our support page. Open the Files app and move the template to "On My iPad/NanoStudio 2/Templates/".

Use the channel (CH) functionality on MONKEY to change between the instruments. The DRM effect will automatically enable the drums.
