/*
SYNCS THE STATE OF THE SAMPLES ON THE DEVICE AND PROVIDES THE API TO PERFORM MODIFICATIONS.

we end up with sone state machine. It is important that we do not end up with an error state where
we continuously upload and download samples due to an error either on the device or app side.

We dont assume the state of the device. Instead, each time we upload and do modifications, we assure by re-downloading from device.
Thus, if these downloads are not to our expectations, then we should not automatically try to fix it. Instead it should error out.

We try to be as non-smart as possible, where the functions does just as they say, and we have to be explicit about actions.
