# Sales terms & conditions

**General**

By placing an order on our website, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. A purchase agreement becomes valid once you receive an order confirmation via email, which also serves as your receipt. These terms, including return and warranty policies, apply only to purchases made directly from Wavy Industries. If you purchased your product through a third-party reseller, please contact the reseller directly for any inquiries or claims.

**Prices and payment**

All prices are listed in euros (EUR) and exclude value-added tax (VAT). Depending on your country of residence, you may be required to pay additional taxes or import duties upon delivery. We accept payment through Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Union Pay, PayPal, Google Pay, iDEAL, Bancontact, and EPS. Payment is charged at the time of purchase.

**Shipping and Delivery**

We ship to most international destinations. Shipping options, applicable fees, and estimated delivery times are shown at checkout before payment is completed. Delivery times may vary depending on your location. Wavy Industries is not responsible for delays caused by customs, local authorities, or third-party courier services. The customer is responsible for complying with their country's import regulations and for paying any associated duties, taxes, or fees.

**Order Changes**

Once an order is placed, we cannot guarantee that it can be modified or canceled before it is shipped. However, if you contact us at [hello@wavyindustries.com](mailto:hello@wavyindustries.com) as quickly as possible, we will do our best to accommodate your request.

**Right of withdrawal**

You have the right to cancel your purchase within 14 days of receiving the product. To initiate a return, you must notify us by email at [hello@wavyindustries.com](mailto:hello@wavyindustries.com) and include your order number. Returned products must be unused, in their original packaging, and in resellable condition. The cost of return shipping is the responsibility of the customer unless the item is defective. Refunds will be processed within 14 business days after the returned item has been received and inspected.

**Warranty and Complaints**

MONKEY is covered by a two-year limited warranty against manufacturing defects from the date of delivery. The warranty does not cover damage resulting from misuse, accidents, unauthorized modifications, or failure to follow usage instructions. If you believe your product is defective, you must contact us at [hello@wavyindustries.com](mailto:hello@wavyindustries.com) and include your order number, a detailed description of the issue, and photos or video showing the defect. We will provide you with further instructions. If a product is to be returned for warranty evaluation, it must be shipped in its original packaging and properly protected. We reserve the right to reject improperly packed items or charge a handling fee.

If you purchased the product from a reseller, the complaint must be addressed directly with the reseller in accordance with their own terms.

**Limitation of Liability**

Wavy Industries shall not be liable for any indirect or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of income, data loss, or business interruption resulting from the use of or inability to use our products. Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the product in question.

**Changes to terms**

We reserve the right to update or change these terms at any time. The most current version will always be available on our website and shall apply immediately from the time of publication.

**Governing Law and Disputes**

These terms and any disputes arising in connection with your purchase shall be governed by Norwegian law. Disputes shall be resolved by Norwegian courts unless consumer protection laws in your country stipulate otherwise.

**Force Majeure**

Wavy Industries shall not be held responsible for any delay or failure in performance caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. This includes, but is not limited to, acts of nature, war, labor disputes, pandemics, government restrictions, transport disruptions, or supply shortages.
