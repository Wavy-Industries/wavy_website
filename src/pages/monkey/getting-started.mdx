# Getting started with MON**KEY**

<img alt="monkey overview" src={monkeyOverviewImg.src} />

MON**KEY** is always powered on while a battery is in it. It will automatically go to sleep when you are not using it, and tapping any of the keys will instantly wake it up. MON**KEY** is expected to last many months on a single battery with moderate usage.

You can force the device into sleep by turning on the lock switch, though this is not generally necessary during normal operation. The switch is intentionally inconvenient to discourage overuse. It is useful when traveling, where accidental key presses in a bag or pocket could repeatedly wake the device.

*To get started, make sure a battery is inserted and the lock switch is in the down position.*

## Device updates & tools
MON**KEY** is updated directly through our website using Bluetooth.

<DeviceUpdateCheck client:load />

Through our *device utility*, you can quickly update the device, explore its functionality, and configure it:

<LinkButton href={routes.deviceUtility} target="_blank">Open device utility</LinkButton>

## Connecting

MON**KEY** supports a variety of hosts and works great in many types of setups. The connection process varies depending on the device you use MON**KEY** with. 

You can experiment directly on our website in the *device utility*, which includes a basic playground.

### Connecting to mobile apps
On Android and iOS/iPadOS, connect MON**KEY** directly within the music apps.

### Connecting to desktop operating systems

<Accordion title="macOS">
  <NoteInfo>Bluetooth MIDI devices will not appear in system Bluetooth settings. Instead, macOS has its own MIDI utility.</NoteInfo>

  We have developed _MIDI Connect_, which simplifies connections on macOS. It's not limited to Wavy devices. This is the easiest way to manage your Bluetooth MIDI devices. If you prefer not to install anything, please skip to the instructions below.

  <LinkButton target="_blank" href={routes.midiConnectAppStore}>MIDI Connect on App Store</LinkButton>
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src={midiConnectImg.src} alt="MIDI Connect preview" />

  If you do not want to download this app, please follow the instructions below.

  **Step 1.** Open _Audio MIDI Setup_.

  <img alt="Search for Bluetooth" src={macConnect.src} />

  **Step 2.** Open MIDI Studio.

  <img alt="Open MIDI studio" src={macConnect2Img.src} />

  **Step 3.** Open the Bluetooth panel.

  <img alt="Open Bluetooth window" src={macConnect3Img.src} />

  Alternatively, if you don't see the Bluetooth icon:

  <img alt="Alternative Bluetooth option" src={macConnect3AltImg.src} />

  **Step 4.** Find your device in the list and connect.

  <img alt="Connect to Monkey" src={macConnect4Img.src} />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Windows">
  Windows currently does not have the best support for MIDI over Bluetooth. The steps below might look a bit complicated, but once the initial setup is done, it shouldn't be difficult thereafter.

  You will need the following programs installed:

  1. **loopMIDI:** [https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html)
  2. **MIDIBerry:** [https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n39720h2m05](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n39720h2m05)

  Then follow these steps to start using MON**KEY**:

  **Step 0.** Windows 11 users must first enable _Advanced device discovery_ in Bluetooth settings.

  <img alt="Windows advanced Bluetooth" src={windowsConnect0Img.src} />

  **Step 1.** Pair MON**KEY** in Windows settings. You only need to do this if MON**KEY** isn't already paired with your computer.

  <img alt="Windows connect" src={windowsConnect1Img.src} />
  <img alt="Windows pairing" src={windowsConnect2Img.src} />
  <img alt="Windows paired" src={windowsConnect3Img.src} />

  **Step 2.** Configure a MIDI port using loopMIDI and name it "my MIDI port."

  <img alt="Port create" src={windowsConnect4Img.src} />

  **Step 3.** Open MIDIBerry, select WAVY MON**KEY** as the input device, and the MIDI port you created as the output.

  You're done! Test it by pressing keys on MON**KEY** and check whether the notes are received in MIDIBerry's _Input Monitor_.

  <img alt="MIDIBerry input" src={windowsConnect5Img.src} />

  Be aware that you need to keep MIDIBerry open to maintain the connection. You might not see any notes received even though everything looks connected. In that case, try disconnecting and reconnecting MON**KEY** in the Windows settings. Also, make sure it's set up exactly as described above.
</Accordion>

### Configure desktop DAW

We provide guides for some DAWs, though MON**KEY** should work with most of them. In short, assign instruments in your DAW to different MIDI channels, and use MIDI channel 10 for a drum rack.

<Accordion title="Ableton Live">
  **Step 1.** Make sure MON**KEY** is enabled in MIDI Ports settings.

  <img alt="Ableton settings" src={abletonSettingsImg.src} />

  **Step 2.** Configure the MIDI channel for each track. Use channels 1-10 for instruments, and channel 10 for your drum rack.

  <img alt="Ableton channel" src={abletonChannelImg.src} />

  Ensure each track is armed for recording.

  <img alt="Ableton arm" src={abletonArmImg.src} />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="FL Studio">
  **Step 1.** Enable the device in FL Studio settings.

  <img alt="FL Studio settings" src={flStudioEnableImg.src} />

  **Step 2.** Lock instruments to the keyboard to receive specific MIDI channels.

  <img alt="FL Studio assign to keyboard" src={flStudioAssignImg.src} />

  **Step 3.** Assign instruments to channels 1-10, and a drum rack to channel 10.

  <img alt="FL Studio configure channel" src={flStudioCh1SelectImg.src} />
  <img alt="FL Studio configure channel" src={flStudioCh10SelectImg.src} />
